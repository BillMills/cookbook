# cookbook

Welcome to the ResBaz cookbook.  This cookbook is for any and all support staff working with researchers to help you do your job better (and thereby contribute to the great ideas which will make our world a better place!).  You should have a browse of the recipes in this book if your job description includes the words "research support" or if you are just interested in how the world is going to change now that researchers are learning to use the latest digital research tools emerging everyday (afterall machines are themselves excellent research companions with an incredible capacity to lift information in a single bound!).  The recipes in this book are intended to help you cope with these people called "researchers".  And by "researcher" we mean any of the following:

  * senior researchers (those who roam the halls of the ivory tower and often own their own castle/cathedral on campus, usually with titles from the medieval ages such as chancellor, associate professor, deputy associate dean, )
  * Sixth form students who are looking to go onto University and change the world.  Old souls in young bods who could be the next Stephen Hawking or Rosalind Franklin (did you know most Noble Peace Prize winners had their Eureka moments before the age of 35!)
  * Middle carreer researchers
  * Undergraduates who show promise 
  * Early carreer researchers: those poor souls who play 
  * Postgraduate students.  Masters students struglling with the decision of carrying on to do a PhD, dreams of grandeur with one in one hundred who will change the world with their ideas!

As you can see by the above, we do not like to discrimnate who can call themselves a "researcher" - we value all researcher contributions regardless of age or stage in their carreer.  We are somewhat biased on one front, and that is our belief that modern research is usually collaborative.  Sure, there is the exception to the rule, but on the whole we don't think most researchers are still doing this:

Rather, we believe that great research teams will be a rich diversity fair all with a part in bringing the research publication to the world... Welcome to the Bazaar (more on why we call this the "research bazaar" (aka #ResBaz later).

The kinds of people who typically read the recipes in this cookbook and contribute their own recipes include (but are not limited to):

  * Are you "the geek" in your lab or department whom everyone always comes to for help.
  * Are you one of those people in the IT departent, endlessly roaming the halls asking if 
  * Do you sit on a helpdesk or call centre
  * Are you a librarian in a small school library, a large University library, a faculty library or online working with a digital library, scholarly publication repository or research datacentre? 
  * foobar...

Ok enough on whom and why you should read this, and onto the recipes!

Ah wait, one more thing!  This cookbook has been written via GitHub so that anyone can come along and rewrite it!  In fact, we have used the metaphor of cookbook so that you can take any of the recipes and rewrite them to fit your organisation point of view.  We have licensed this cookbook and all it recipes with a "creative-commons-share-alike" license which means you should expect other people to come along and copy your recipes so they can rewrite it as well <-- think about all the lovely new dishes we'll be able to share with one another!

The recipes in this cookbook are broadly categorised in three chapters:

  # Chapter 1: ResBaz Campaign Recipes
  # Chapter 2: ResBaz Community Recipes
  # Chapter 3: ResBaz Conference Recipes

The reason we have split these three chapters out is because we believe you can start with any of recipes in any order of this cookbook however as you make your way through each recipe you'll wonder: "which recipe should I try next" and naturally we would suggest you continue making your way through the chapter in whih you have been working.
